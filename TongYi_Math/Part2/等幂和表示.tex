Example: $m,n$为正整数，$m\neq n$, 求证:$m^4+4n^4$可以表示为四个正整数的平方和  
\clearpage
Hints:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(m^4+n^2-2m^2n^2)+2n^2(m^2+n^2)+n^4$
\end{itemize}

\clearpage
Example:求证任意整数可以表示为五个整数的立方和的形式 
\clearpage
Hints:
\begin{itemize}
\item $6x=(x-1)^3+(x+1)^3+(-x)^3+(-x)^3$
\item $n^3-n=6x$ 
\item 或者分别考虑$6x\pm1, 6x+2, 6x+3, 6x+4$
\end{itemize}

Example:求证存在无穷多个整数，他们不能写成三个整数的立方和的形式 
\clearpage
Hints:
\begin{itemize}
\item mod9 
\end{itemize}

Example:证明两个整数的平方和乘以另外两个整数的平方和可以表示为某两个整数的平方和 
\clearpage
Hints:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(a^2+b^2)(x^2+y^2)=(ax+by)^2+(ay-bx)^2=(ax-by)^2+(ay+bx)^2$
\item 由此推出柯西不等式在$n=2$时候的特例，尝试证明柯西不等式
\item 推广命题到四个整数的情形
